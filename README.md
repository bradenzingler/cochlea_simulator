## Cochlear Simulation Model (CSM)

This project was created to visually display and explain how the cochlea translates sound waves into electrical impulses within the inner ear at a high level. This model can be understood by people of any age, background, or level of education. Our goal is to increase access to information about hearing loss and to help those with sensorineural hearing loss understand why they cannot hear as well as they once could.
